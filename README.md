# 🩺 Disease Prediction Using Symptoms (AIML Project)

This project uses machine learning to predict the most probable disease based on user-input symptoms using a Random Forest Classifier.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Diagnosing diseases based on overlapping symptoms can be challenging and time-consuming. This project aims to build a model that predicts diseases with high accuracy using symptom data.

## ✅ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Disease Symptom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)
- Preprocessed using one-hot encoding of symptoms
- Target: Disease name

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: **100%** on test data
- Evaluated using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 🔍 Sample Prediction

```python
user_input = ['itching', 'skin_rash', 'nodal_skin_eruptions']
# Output: Fungal infection
📌 Future Scope
      1.Integrate with Streamlit for a web app
      2.Add lab test reports for precision
      3.Expand to deep learning models like RNNs
